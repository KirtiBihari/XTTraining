                Team, In recent calls and town halls with Alan and other Publicis.Sapient leaders, including myself, you will have had the
                opportunity to hear about our strategy of being the best Digital Business Transformation partner to our clients
                and how we are currently transforming ourselves to lead in that space. As part of that ongoing programme
                of communication, aimed at a common understanding of Digital Business Transformation and how we organise
                to deliver it, I’m pleased to share with you these two videos – shot at the recent Publicis Groupe seminar
                in Paris, where I presented our strategy to 400 Publicis Groupe leaders. In the first video, I explore what
                we mean by Digital Business Transformation, how we work with clients to build businesses of the future and
                why the imperative is for organisations to transform now.
